Welcome the users guide of the *h5cpp* HDF5 C++ wrapper. 

.. important::

    If you are new to this library we recommend you to read through the 
    sections in the order they are presented here. 
    
    In any case, even as an experienced C++ programmer you definitely should 
    read the :ref:`design-overview` chapter as it introduces the terminology 
    used in the rest of this manual and througout the entire documentation. 
    Without reading this it would be difficult for you to understand even the 
    basic concepts descriped as you would not know the meaning of particular 
    terms. 
    
    :ref:`design-overview` was deliberately kept short so that reading it 
    does not become a burden. But please read it. Its important!
