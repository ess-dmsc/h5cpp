//! \brief availability requirement of a filter
//!
//! When a filter is applied to a dataset creation property list the
//! user in general must declare a degree of availability for the filter.
//! A filter can be either \i optional or \i mandatory. In the former case
//! the filter is simply omitted if not available (for instance an external
//! filter) in the latter case the operation fails if the filter is not
//! available.
//!
//! This enumeration type is used to mark a filter as optional or mandatory.
